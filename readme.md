## Motivation

I type every day and believes it is worth switching to a more efficient 
keyboard, specifically the Modified Colemak Programming keyboard.

## OS

I use Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems.

## Why Colemak

No reason. I just read about the layout being efficient when practising touch
typing.

## My Layout Approach -> English based

1. I have been utilizing a software remapping approach for the past two years.
2. I have recently transitioned to using a programmable keyboard as my preferred method.
    - I program my layout on the keyboard and can use it across various devices.

Occasionally, when I need to concentrate on my laptop, I still rely on the software approach to utilize the laptop keyboard. Therefore, I will ensure that both methods are kept up to date.
